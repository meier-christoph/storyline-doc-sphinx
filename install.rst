Installation
============

In this section we will guide you through the setup of your developer
workstation in order to get you started as a contributor to storyline.

First, all sub-projects of storyline are hosted on github_ which means
that you must have git installed before you can do anything.

.. _github: http://github.com

Second, all applications required for storyline are running inside
docker_ containers. While Docker itself is already great, we use a 
little tool named fig_ to turn it pure awesomeness.

.. _docker: http://docker.io
.. _fig: http://fig.sh
